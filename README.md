# N-body-simulation-
An N-body simulation using both python and cython, utilising OpenMP and MPI, using a particle mesh method. Simulation model superclusotrs of galaxies, with the aim was optimise run times utiliseing different parallel computation techniques, simulations ran on the blue crystal supercomputer. Report is provided in the repository.

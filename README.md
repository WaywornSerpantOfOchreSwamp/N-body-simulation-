# N-body-simulation-
An N-body simulation using both python and cython, utilising OpenMP and MPI, using a particle mesh method, specically a grid partition and a fast fourier transform for gravitiational forces, and a simplist numerical integrator. Simulation modes dynamics of a superclusotrs of galaxies, with the aim of optimising run-times across different parallel computation techniques. The simulations ran on the blue crystal supercomputer. Report is provided in the repository.
